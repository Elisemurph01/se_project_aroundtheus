**Technologies used**
I used VS code for creating the main layout of the website as well as Google Devtools for verifying sizing and layout of the project. I also used various CSS and HTML Validators to verify the validity of the code before submitting. The Project as a whole was created based off of an HTML layout with CSS used to style it, and Javascript to validate and control the functions of the webpage. I hope you enjoy!
